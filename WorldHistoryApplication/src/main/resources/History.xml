		<description>
			<p>What is the Cambrian period known for? Explosion of life.</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, two things make the Cambrian Period notable. First, life exploded with almost all the major groups evolving in a relatively short time (about 40 million years). Second, the rise of animals with hard shells meant they had a much better chance of becoming fossilized.</p>
			<p>What caused the Cambrian extinction? The two most accepted current hypotheses for the Cambrian extinction are: Glaciation in the early Ordovician. Cooling and depletion of oxygen in marine waters.</p>

		<description>
			<p>What is the Ordovician period known for? The Ordovician is best known for its diverse marine invertebrates, including graptolites, trilobites, brachiopods, and the conodonts (early vertebrates). A typical marine community consisted of these animals, plus red and green algae, primitive fish, cephalopods, corals, crinoids, and gastropods.</p>

		<description>
			<p>What is the Silurian period known for? Possibly the most remarkable biological event during the Silurian was the evolution and diversification of fish. Not only does this time period mark the wide and rapid spread of jawless fish, but also the appearances of both the first known freshwater fish and the first fish with jaws.</p>

			<p>The Carboniferous is the first period in which today's coal beds began to form.</p>
			<p>The Carboniferous was the period when faunal life became established on land. Floral life became established on land during the previous period, the Devonian period, and began to flourish during the Carboniferous.</p>

		<description>
			<p>What is Permian period known for? During the Permian Period, Earth's crustal plates formed a single, massive continent called Pangaea. In the correspondingly large ocean, Panthalassa, marine organisms such as brachiopods, gastropods, cephalopods (nautiloids and ammonoids), and crinoids were present. On land, reptiles replaced amphibians in abundance.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The dramatic event of this time period was the last "Ice Age." The Pleistocene Epoch also was the last time that a great diversity of mammals lived in North America, including mammoths, mastodons, giant sloths, several llama-like camels, and tapirs. And it was the last epoch native horses lived in North America.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The Anthropocene is a proposed geological epoch dating from the commencement of significant human impact on Earth's geology and ecosystems.</p>
			<p>Various start dates have been proposed, but the peak in radionuclides fallout consequential to atomic bomb testing during the 1950s has been more favoured than others, locating a possible beginning of the Anthropocene to the detonation of the first atomic bomb in 1945.</p>
