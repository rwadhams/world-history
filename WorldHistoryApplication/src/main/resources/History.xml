		<description>
			<p>Flinders entered the Royal Navy in 1789 and became a navigator who charted much of the Australian coast.</p>
			<p>In 1795 he sailed to Australia, where he explored and charted its southeast coast and circumnavigated the island of Tasmania.</p> 
			<p>As commander of the Investigator, he again sailed from England for Australia in 1801. On this visit he surveyed the entire southern coast, from Cape Leeuwin, in the southwest, to the Bass Strait, which separates mainland Australia from Tasmania.</p>
			<p>On July 22, 1802, he sailed from Sydney (on Port Jackson) and charted the east coast of Australia and the Gulf of Carpentaria on the north coast. Continuing westward and southward, he circumnavigated Australia and again reached Port Jackson on June 9, 1803.</p>
			<p>In December, on the voyage back to England, the condition of his ship required him to stop at the ÃŽle de France (now Mauritius) in the western Indian Ocean. There he was interned by the French authorities and was not allowed to leave for England until 1810. His "Voyage to Terra Australis" appeared shortly before his death.</p>

			<p>World War II was the biggest and deadliest war in history, involving more than 30 countries.</p>
			<p>Sparked by the 1939 Nazi invasion of Poland, the war dragged on for six bloody years until the Allies defeated the Axis powers of Nazi Germany, Japan and Italy in 1945.</p>

			<p>New military technology resulted in unprecedented carnage. By the time the war was over and the Allied Powers claimed victory, more than 16 million people - soldiers and civilians alike - were dead.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The Vietnam War was a long, costly and divisive conflict that pitted the communist government of North Vietnam against South Vietnam and its principal ally, the United States.</p>
			<p>The conflict was intensified by the ongoing Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
			<p>More than 3 million people (including over 58,000 Americans) were killed in the Vietnam War, and more than half of the dead were Vietnamese civilians.</p>
			<p>Opposition to the war in the United States bitterly divided Americans, even after President Richard Nixon signed the Paris Peace Accords and ordered the withdrawal of U.S. forces in 1973.</p>
			<p>Communist forces ended the war by seizing control of South Vietnam in 1975, and the country was unified as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam the following year.</p>

		<description>
			<p>What is the Cambrian period known for? Explosion of life.</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, two things make the Cambrian Period notable. First, life exploded with almost all the major groups evolving in a relatively short time (about 40 million years). Second, the rise of animals with hard shells meant they had a much better chance of becoming fossilized.</p>
			<p>What caused the Cambrian extinction? The two most accepted current hypotheses for the Cambrian extinction are: Glaciation in the early Ordovician. Cooling and depletion of oxygen in marine waters.</p>

			<p>What is the Ordovician period known for? The Ordovician is best known for its diverse marine invertebrates, including graptolites, trilobites, brachiopods, and the conodonts (early vertebrates). A typical marine community consisted of these animals, plus red and green algae, primitive fish, cephalopods, corals, crinoids, and gastropods.</p>

			<p>What is the Silurian period known for? Possibly the most remarkable biological event during the Silurian was the evolution and diversification of fish. Not only does this time period mark the wide and rapid spread of jawless fish, but also the appearances of both the first known freshwater fish and the first fish with jaws.</p>

			<p>The Carboniferous is the first period in which today's coal beds began to form.</p>
			<p>The Carboniferous was the period when faunal life became established on land. Floral life became established on land during the previous period, the Devonian period, and began to flourish during the Carboniferous.</p>

			<p>What is Permian period known for? During the Permian Period, Earth's crustal plates formed a single, massive continent called Pangaea. In the correspondingly large ocean, Panthalassa, marine organisms such as brachiopods, gastropods, cephalopods (nautiloids and ammonoids), and crinoids were present. On land, reptiles replaced amphibians in abundance.</p>

The Pleistocene Epoch also was the last time that a great diversity of mammals lived in North America, including mammoths, mastodons, giant sloths, several llama-like camels, and tapirs. And it was the last epoch native horses lived in North America.</p>

			<p>The Anthropocene is a proposed geological epoch dating from the commencement of significant human impact on Earth's geology and ecosystems.</p>
			<p>Various start dates have been proposed, but the peak in radionuclides fallout consequential to atomic bomb testing during the 1950s has been more favoured than others, locating a possible beginning of the Anthropocene to the detonation of the first atomic bomb in 1945.</p>
